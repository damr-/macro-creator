# Personal Macro
A windows application which lets you create personal macros to be executed automatically

## TODO 
- Re-Do HitKey widget:
  - Writing characters: checkboxes or selectable dropdown for Ctrl/Alt/Shift + 1 letter lineedit
  - checkboxes or selectable dropdown for Ctrl/Alt/Shift + Hotkey detection for hitting a specific key or key combination  
- For Wait-Cmds add qApp->execute... after every 5 seconds or so to not make program hang up
